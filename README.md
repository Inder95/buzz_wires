# buzz_wires
An example of Arduino's capacitive sense library (see website: https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor?from=Main.CapSense)

The buzz wires game where you have to take a wire loop through a jaggety wire can be made by using capacitie sense where the jaggety wire behaves as a capacitor and touching it changes the capacitance. This library helps to sense that change in capacitance easily.
